# Angular 2 QuickStart Source with Gulp

## The core of this was created by the good folks over @angular, I have added Gulp processing. Have fun let me know where there can be improvements.

To compile the typescript, in terminal run "npm run tsc" without the quotes. You will have to do this everytime you want to compile your typescript. Gulp can run in another terminal window and will handle the rest from there. Also as a note through my development process, if you're using Chrome, be sure to open up your inspector panel go to network and click network

This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the [angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html),
the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your application.

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v5.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.
